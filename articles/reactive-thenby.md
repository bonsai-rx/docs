`ThenBy` operates on sequences returned by any of the <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.OrderBy"/>, <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.OrderByDescending"/>, <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.ThenBy"/>, or <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.ThenByDescending"/> operators. For each ordered collection emitted by the source sequence, the result sequence will emit a new ordered collection where elements in the collection are subsequently sorted in ascending order of the keys specified in the <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.ThenBy.KeySelector"/> property.
