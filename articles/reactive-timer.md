`Timer` can either generate a single value, if <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.Timer.Period"/> is not specified, or an infinite sequence of values emitted periodically. The first value of `Timer` is emitted after the specified <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.Timer.DueTime"/>.

> [!Warning]
> The value of the <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.Timer.DueTime"/> and <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.Timer.Period"/> properties cannot be modified after the observable sequence has initialized. If dynamic configuration is necessary, make sure that all properties are immediately configured using property mapping operators.
