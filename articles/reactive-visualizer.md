The `Visualizer` operator is a [Sink](xref:Bonsai.Reactive.Sink) which uses the nested workflow to specify a reactive visualizer function over the elements of the source sequence. `Visualizer` emits all values from the source sequence directly without modification, and the nested sequence is subscribed to purely for its side-effects.

> [!Note]
> All notifications emitted by the inner [**WorkflowOutput**](xref:Bonsai.Expressions.WorkflowOutputBuilder) node are ignored. However, the type visualizer assigned to the nested workflow output will be considered as the default visualizer of the outer node.
