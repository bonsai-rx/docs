The `OrderBy` operator requires the elements in the source sequence to be collections implementing the <xref href="System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1"/> interface. For each collection emitted by the source sequence, the result sequence will emit an ordered collection where elements are sorted in ascending order of the keys specified in the <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.OrderBy.KeySelector"/> property.
