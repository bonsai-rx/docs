The `Accumulate` operator returns the current value of the cumulative sum each time the source sequence emits a notification. The result sequence terminates successfully when the source sequence terminates successfully.

### Example

Use `Accumulate` to continuously update a value by adding up the changes over time.

### Alternative

Use [`Sum`](xref:Bonsai.Reactive.Sum) instead to yield a single accumulated value at the end of a sequence.
