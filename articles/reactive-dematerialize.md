`Dematerialize` is the complement of <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.Materialize"/>. `Dematerialize` reconstructs the implicit notifications of an observable sequence from a sequence of explicit notifications. This can be useful if you have materialized a sequence for debugging or logging purposes but still need to retain the original sequence.
