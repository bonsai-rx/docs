### Type Visualizers

Type visualizers allow you to inspect online the data that is generated by any specific node during the execution of the workflow. They are useful to debug the result of image or signal processing operations or to debug the behaviour of the workflow itself.

Types can have more than one visualizer. You can choose the active type visualizer for a specific operator by right-clicking on the corresponding node and selecting from the available options in the `Show Visualizer` menu.

For example, image streams can be displayed on the screen using the default image visualizer, but you can also select the text visualizer to access image parameters such as size, or pixel bit depth. New visualizers can be added by installing new packages.

If you leave one or more visualizers open when you stop the workflow, Bonsai will memorize the position and size of each active window. When you run the workflow again, the same visualizer windows will be opened following the memorized layout. Bonsai stores these settings in a `.layout` file which is saved side by side with the workflow so they will persist between editor sessions.

**ProTip:** Many visualizers allow you to access more detailed information or advanced configuration parameters by right-clicking on the visualizer window.
