Binary operators are applied over sequences of pairs of values, as long as the corresponding arithmetic and logic operator exists for the specific combination of input types.

> [!Note]
> Binary arithmetic and logic operators can also be applied to sequences of single values. In this case, a workflow property will be inferred based on the type of the elements in the source sequence and exposed in the property grid. The value of this property will be used as the right-hand side when applying the binary operator to the elements in the source sequence.
