# Design Guidelines

This section provides guidelines for designing workflows and packages that extend or interface with Bonsai. The goal is to help avoid common pitfalls, share best practices, and promote consistency when working with the visual language and reactive programming in general.

The guidelines are organized as a series of recommendations prefixed with the terms `DO`, `CONSIDER`, `AVOID`, and `DO NOT`. These recommendations are intended to help understand the trade-offs between different approaches to solving problems in Bonsai. There might be situations where the best solution to a problem requires you to violate these design guidelines. In this case, you should still use the design guidelines as a way to understand and reason about your decision.
