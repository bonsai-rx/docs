# Creating a Package

The Bonsai language can be easily extended with custom operators, which are installed and shared using assembly packages. These packages are typically written in the C# programming language, using the [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) development environment.

## Install pre-requisites

1. [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/). You can install the Community edition for free.
2. Bonsai VS Extensions. In the Windows Start Menu, search for the "**Install Bonsai VS Extensions**" shortcut and run it.

## Create a package project

1. Start **Visual Studio**.
2. Create a **New Project**. In the **New Project** dialog, there should now be a project template for creating a Bonsai package, under **Templates/Visual C#/Bonsai**. ![Creating a new Bonsai package project](~/images/extensions-packageproject.png)
3. After the project is created, you should see that a file "**Transform1.cs**" has been created and added to the solution explorer. This file contains an example implementation of a custom transform node. ![Bonsai transform template](~/images/extensions-transformtemplate.png)
4. `TSource` and `TResult` specify the input and output data types of the transform and you can modify them however you want. Every Bonsai node operates on observable sequences using the [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) framework. Transforms are nodes which apply an operation to every item in the input sequence. The simplest way to implement a transform is by using the [`Select`](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/map.html) operator from Rx. As an example, we will modify the transform in order to apply a sine operation on numeric inputs. ![Implementation of a sine transform](~/images/extensions-transformsine.png)
5. We can test our transform by starting the project with **F5**. This will automatically launch the Bonsai editor with our package preloaded in the **Toolbox**. Add a `Timer` source and our `Transform1` node. Set the timer period to some reasonable value like 0.1 seconds and run the workflow. ![Running the sine transform](~/images/extensions-running.png)
6. It is also possible to debug our code while it is running by setting breakpoints, either by clicking on the left of the line we want to debug or by hitting **F9** over the target code. After this, you can run the code step by step and inspect the runtime value of variables. ![Setting a breakpoint on the sine transform](~/images/extensions-breakpoint.png) ![Debugging the sine transform](~/images/extensions-debugging.png)
