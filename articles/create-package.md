# Create a Package

The Bonsai language can be extended with custom packages, which are installed and shared using [NuGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget). Packages are typically written in the C# programming language, using the [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) development environment. Once you have developed and refined your custom extensions you can package the code for installing in the Bonsai editor, or sharing with the community.

## Pre-requisites

1. [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/). You can install the Community edition for free.
2. [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
3. Open a command prompt or system terminal and install `Bonsai.Templates`:

```cmd
dotnet new install Bonsai.Templates
```

## Creating a package project

1. Start **Visual Studio**.

2. Select the **Create a new project** option. In the **Create a new project** dialog, type `bonsai` in the search toolbox. Select the **Bonsai Package** template to create a new Bonsai package.

> [!WARNING]
> If you see multiple duplicate entries, you may have leftover deprecated `Bonsai VS extensions` from a previous Bonsai installation. To uninstall them, go to **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions** in Visual Studio.

3. Give the project a name and a location, and press the `Create` button. After the project is created, you should see that a file "**Source1.cs**" has been added to the solution explorer. This file contains an example implementation of a custom source.

    ![Bonsai source template](~/images/extensions-sourcetemplate.png)

4. Every Bonsai operator specifies an observable sequence using the <xref href="System.IObservable`1"/> interface. The [System.Reactive](http://reactivex.io/) package provides a comprehensive library of methods used to generate and manipulate observable sequences in C#. The simplest way to implement a source is by using the methods in the <xref href="System.Reactive.Linq.Observable"/> class.

    As an example, the expression below will generate a simple periodic sinewave by applying the projection operator <xref href="System.Reactive.Linq.Observable.Select*"/> to the incremental counter sequence generated by a <xref href="System.Reactive.Linq.Observable.Timer*"/>.

    ```c#
    [Description("")]
    [Combinator(MethodName = nameof(Generate))]
    [WorkflowElementCategory(ElementCategory.Source)]
    public class Source1
    {
        public IObservable<double> Generate()
        {
            return Observable
                .Timer(
                    dueTime: TimeSpan.Zero,
                    period: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(0.5))
                .Select(counter => Math.Sin(counter));
        }
    }
    ```

5. We can test our operator by starting the project with **F5**. This will automatically launch the Bonsai editor with our package preloaded in the **Toolbox**. Add the new `Source1` node and run the workflow.

6. If we need to parameterize our operator, we can add new public properties to the class. Custom editors can be used to provide interactive widgets for editing the property values. Several common widgets are provided in the <xref href="Bonsai.DesignTypes"/> class. For example, to make the period customizable with a slider over a specified range, we can modify our source operator:

    ```c#
    [Description("")]
    [Combinator(MethodName = nameof(Generate))]
    [WorkflowElementCategory(ElementCategory.Source)]
    public class Source1
    {
        [Range(0.1, 2)]
        [Editor(DesignTypes.SliderEditor, DesignTypes.UITypeEditor)]
        public double PeriodSeconds { get; set; } = 0.5;

        public IObservable<double> Generate()
        {
            return Observable
                .Timer(
                    dueTime: TimeSpan.Zero,
                    period: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(PeriodSeconds))
                .Select(counter => Math.Sin(counter));
        }
    }
    ```

7. It is also possible to debug our code while it is running by setting breakpoints, either by clicking on the left of the line we want to debug or by hitting **F9** over the target code. After this, you can run the code step by step and inspect the runtime value of variables.

    ![Debugging the sine source](~/images/extensions-debugging.png)

8. Finally, we can add new operators by right-clicking the project name in the solution explorer and selecting `Add` > `New Item`. Templates for creating the most common operator types are available under the **Bonsai** category.

    ![Creating a new Bonsai transform](~/images/extensions-itemtemplate.png)

    For example, we can create a simple transform that tests whether each of the values emitted by the sinewave generator is positive:

    ```c#
    [Combinator]
    [Description("")]
    [WorkflowElementCategory(ElementCategory.Transform)]
    public class Transform1
    {
        public IObservable<bool> Process(IObservable<double> source)
        {
            return source.Select(input => input > 0);
        }
    }
    ```

> [!TIP]
> Use [XML documentation comments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags) to document your code. 
> Check out the [Documentation with docfx](./documentation-docfx.md) article for information on how to use [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/index.html) to automatically generate documentation pages for your package.

## Publishing a package project

1. Double-click the name of the project in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer to open up the package metadata.

    ![Inspecting the package metadata](~/images/extensions-packagemetadata.png)

2. Fill in or edit all the relevant metadata fields. These are critical to correctly communicate the provenance of your project to other users. Please pay special attention to `Title`, `Description`, `Authors`, `Copyright`, `PackageProjectUrl`, `PackageLicenseExpression`, `PackageIcon` and `PackageTags` to make sure that they correctly describe your project. Make sure that `Version` is correctly assigned in every new release to avoid problems during package updates. In order to make your project discoverable through the Bonsai package manager, make sure to include the `PackageType` field and specify both `Dependency` and `BonsaiLibrary` as package types.

    > [!Tip]
    > Use version suffixes for sharing prerelease versions for testing, e.g. `0.1.0-alpha`. If a package version has a prerelease suffix, it will only be listed by the package manager if the checkbox "Include prerelease" is checked.

3. Build the project in **Release** mode. If all metadata is correctly specified, the build process should generate a `.nupkg` file as part of the output. By default, it will be placed in the same `bin\Release` folder where the project assembly (.dll) is generated.

4. To install the package in the editor, [configure a new package source](./packages.md#configure-package-sources) pointing to a folder containing your generated `.nupkg` file, or simply copy the `.nupkg` file to the `Gallery` folder of your local Bonsai installation. The package should then be listed in the package manager (make sure to select the package source where the package is located if you cannot find it in the list).

    > [!Warning]
    > If you have your custom package installed in the same editor used to debug the source code, Bonsai will prefer the installed package over the compiled source code library. In this case, either uninstall the package, or use a local Bonsai installation.

    > [!Note]
    > If you would like to share the package with the broader Bonsai community, consider publishing it to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/manage/upload) by creating a NuGet account and uploading the `.nupkg` file. Ensure the `PackageType` field is properly defined before submission.
