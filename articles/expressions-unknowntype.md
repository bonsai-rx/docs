> [!Note]
> Unknown types are created when the compiler is unable to resolve a type reference specified in the workflow. This is usually caused by a missing package that needs to be installed, but sometimes it might also indicate missing native dependencies required by the package. Please refer to the specific package documentation for guidance when debugging unknown types.
