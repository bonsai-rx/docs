# Installing Bonsai

The Bonsai editor is currently designed to work with the .NET framework on Windows desktop operating systems, version 7 or later. The easiest way to get started with Bonsai is by downloading the latest installer.

The latest stable release is: **2.6.3 (2.6.3.3552)**

[<i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download Installer (.exe)](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/bonsai/releases/download/2.6.3/Bonsai-2.6.3.exe){: .btn .btn--success}
[<i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download Portable (.zip)](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/bonsai/releases/download/2.6.3/Bonsai.zip){: .btn .btn--warning}

The installer will make sure that .NET and any other required system dependencies for running Bonsai are correctly setup in your computer.
