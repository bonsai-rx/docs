`WindowCount` groups the notifications of the source sequence into new observable sequences containing the number of elements specified in the <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.WindowCount.Count"/> property. The overlap between the elements in each window can be controlled using the <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.WindowCount.Skip"/> property.

If no skip value is provided, the windows will be strictly non-overlapping, with a new window beginning when the previous window ends. If the skip value is less than the specified number of elements, windows will be overlapping, with a new window created every `Skip` notifications. Finally, if the skip value is greater than the specified number of elements, there will be a gap between each window where elements from the source sequence will be dropped.

> [!Note]
> You can manipulate and schedule each of the windows downstream using other higher-order operators such as [**Merge**](xref:Bonsai.Reactive.Merge), [**Concat**](xref:Bonsai.Reactive.Concat) or [**Switch**](xref:Bonsai.Reactive.Switch).
