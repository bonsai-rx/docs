The `WindowTime` operator groups the notifications of the source sequence into new observable sequences, where each window contains the elements emitted during the specified <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.WindowTime.TimeSpan"/>. The overlap between the elements in each window can be controlled using the <xref href="Bonsai.Reactive.WindowTime.TimeShift"/> property.

If no `TimeShift` is provided, the windows will be strictly non-overlapping, with a new window beginning when the previous window ends. If `TimeShift` is smaller than `TimeSpan`, windows will be overlapping, with a new buffer created every `TimeShift` interval. Finally, if `TimeShift` is larger than `TimeSpan`, there will be a time gap between each window where elements from the source sequence may be dropped.

> [!Note]
> You can manipulate and schedule each of the windows downstream using other higher-order operators such as [**Merge**](xref:Bonsai.Reactive.Merge), [**Concat**](xref:Bonsai.Reactive.Concat) or [**Switch**](xref:Bonsai.Reactive.Switch).
