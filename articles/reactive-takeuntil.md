`TakeUntil` modifies the source sequence so that values are emitted only until the second sequence produces a value. At that time, `TakeUntil` will terminate immediately and ignore the remainder of the sequence. TakeUntil is often used to create a dynamic stop condition for an infinite sequence.

If the source sequence terminates before the second sequence produces a value, `TakeUntil` will also terminate and cancel the subscription to the second sequence.

### Examples

Use `TakeUntil` to stop taking elements from an active sequence.

#### Stop Video Recording

Use `TakeUntil` to stop video recording when a trigger is sent (e.g. key press).

> This example requires the `Bonsai.Vision`, `Bonsai.Vision.Design`, and `Bonsai.Windows.Input` packages to be installed.
