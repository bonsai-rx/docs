> If the operator is applied to a sequence of single values, a workflow property will be inferred based on compatible operator overloads and exposed in the property grid. The value of this property will be used as the argument when applying the operator to the elements in the source sequence.

If the operator is applied to a sequence of pairs of values, the second element in the pair is considered to be the argument to the operator.
