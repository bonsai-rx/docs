## Bonsai Project Contributor Agreement

This contributor agreement was inspired by the [Bonsai Project Contributor Agreement](https://Bonsaiproject.org/wiki/Legal:Bonsai_Project_Contributor_Agreement), which served as a template for the agreement. 

To get started as a contributor to the Bonsai Documentation, please first read through the Bonsai Project Contributor Agreement below.

### Overview

The only purpose of the Bonsai Project Contributor Agreement (BPCA) is to ensure that Bonsai has default permission to use your contributions under a permissive free license (either MIT for software or CC BY-SA for content). You may contribute under any other acceptable Bonsai license, the BPCA simply sets a default if no license is specified.

Nothing in the BPCA takes anything away from you. You retain ownership of your contributions.

If you have any questions about the BPCA, please email contact@NeuroGEARS.org.

### BPCA Text

The Bonsai Project Contributor Agreement
Version 2022-03-10

#### Goal

We require that contributors to Bonsai (as defined below) 
agree to this Bonsai Project Contributor Agreement (BPCA) 
to ensure that contributions to Bonsai have acceptable 
licensing terms. 

#### Non-Goals

The BPCA is *not* a copyright assignment agreement. 

The BPCA does *not* somehow supersede the existing 
licensing terms that apply to Bonsai contributions. There 
are two important subpoints here.  First, the BPCA does not 
apply to upstream code (or other material) that you didn't 
write; indeed, it would be preposterous for it to attempt 
to do so.  Note the narrow way in which we have defined 
capital-c "Contribution".  Second, the main provision of 
the BPCA specifies that a default license will apply to 
code that you wrote, but only to the extent that you have 
not bothered to put an explicit license on it. Therefore, 
the BPCA is *not* some sort of special permissive license 
granted to any party, despite the explicit choice of a more 
restrictive license by you or by upstream developers.

#### Terms


1.  Definitions.

"Acceptable License For Bonsai" means a license selected 
from the appropriate categorical sublist of the full list 
of acceptable licenses for Bonsai, currently located at 
[NEED LINK TO LIST OF ACCEPTABLE LICENSES], as that list 
may be revised from time to time by the **Bonsai Council** 
[PLACEHOLDER] [WHO IS THE GOVERNING BODY OF BONSAI?].  
"Acceptable Licenses For Bonsai" means that full list.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-
ShareAlike 4.0 International license, as published at 
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode>.

"Code" means (i) software code, (ii) any other functional  
material whose principal purpose is to control or 
facilitate the building of packages, such as an RPM spec 
file, (iii) font files, and (iv) other kinds of 
copyrightable material that the **Bonsai Council** 
[PLACEHOLDER] has classified as "code" rather than 
"content".

"Content" means any copyrightable material that is not 
Code, such as, without limitation, (i) non-functional data 
sets, (ii) documentation, (iii) wiki edits, (iv) video 
files, (v) graphic image files, (vi) help files, and (vii) 
other kinds of copyrightable material that the **Bonsai 
Council** [PLACEHOLDER] has classified as "content" rather 
than "code".

"Contribution" means a Work that You created, excluding any 
portion that was created by someone else.  (For example, if 
You Submit a package to Bonsai, the spec file You write may 
be a Contribution, but all the upstream code in the 
associated SRPM that You did not write is not a 
Contribution for purposes of this FPCA.)  A Contribution 
consists either of Code or of Content.

"Current Default License", with respect to a Contribution, 
means (i) if the Contribution is Code, the MIT License, 
and (ii) if the Contribution is Content, CC-BY-SA.

"Bonsai" means the community project led by the **Bonsai 
Council** [PLACEHOLDER] 
<https://Bonsaiproject.org/wiki/Council> **[NEED TO UPDATE 
THIS LINK]**.

"Bonsai Community" means (i) all Bonsai users, (ii) Bonsai 
developers, and (iii) all persons receiving Contributions 
directly or indirectly from or through Bonsai.

"Licensed" means covered by explicit licensing terms that 
are conspicuous and readily discernible to recipients.

"MIT License" means the license identified as "Modern Style 
with sublicense" at 
<https://Bonsaiproject.org/wiki/Licensing:MIT#Modern_Style_with_sublicense> 
**[NEED TO UPDATE THIS LINK]**.

"Submit" means to use some mode of digital communication 
(for example, without limitation, mailing lists, bug 
tracking systems, and source code version control systems 
administered by Bonsai) to voluntarily provide a 
Contribution to Bonsai.

"Unlicensed" means not Licensed.

"Work" means a copyrightable work of authorship. A Work may 
be a portion of a larger Work, and a Work may be a 
modification of or addition to another Work.

"You" means the individual accepting this instance of the 
FPCA.


1. Copyright Permission Required for All Contributions.

If You are not the copyright holder of a given Contribution 
that You wish to Submit to Bonsai (for example, if Your 
employer or university holds copyright in it), it is Your 
responsibility to first obtain authorization from the 
copyright holder to Submit the Contribution under the terms 
of this FPCA on behalf of, or otherwise with the permission 
of, that copyright holder.  One form of such authorization 
is for the copyright holder to place, or permit You to 
place, an Acceptable License For Bonsai on the Contribution.


1.  Licensed Contributions.

If Your Contribution is Licensed, Your Contribution will be 
governed by the terms under which it has been licensed.


1.  Default Licensing of Unlicensed Contributions.

If You Submit an Unlicensed Contribution to Bonsai, the 
license to the Bonsai Community for that Contribution shall 
be the Current Default License.

The **Bonsai Council** [PLACEHOLDER] may, by public 
announcement, subsequently designate an additional or 
alternative default license for a given category of 
Contribution (a "Later Default License"). A Later Default 
License shall be chosen from the appropriate categorical 
sublist of Acceptable Licenses For Bonsai.

Once a Later Default License has been designated, Your 
Unlicensed Contribution shall also be licensed to the 
Bonsai Community under that Later Default License.  Such 
designation shall not affect the continuing applicability 
of the Current Default License to Your Contribution.

You consent to having Bonsai provide reasonable notice of 
Your licensing of Your Contribution under the Current 
Default License (and, if applicable, a Later Default 
License) in a manner determined by Bonsai.

1.  Public Domain United States Government Works. **[NOT 
SURE IF WE NEED THIS SECTION; IF WE DO, DO WE NEED TO SAY 
SOMETHING ABOUT UK GOV?]**

Sections 1 through 3 of this FPCA do not apply to any 
Contribution to the extent that it is a work of the United 
States Government for which copyright is unavailable under 
17 U.S.C. 105.

1.  Acceptance.

You must signify Your assent to the terms of this FPCA 
through specific electronic means established by Bonsai 
(such as by click-through acceptance means).

You may also, at Your option, and without eliminating the 
requirement set forth in the preceding paragraph, send a 
copy of this FPCA, bearing Your written signature 
indicating Your acceptance of its terms, by email to 
**legal@Bonsaiproject.org [PLACEHOLDER]**, by fax to 
**+1 919 754 3704 [PLACEHOLDER]**, or by postal mail to:

Bonsai Legal  
c/o Red Hat, Inc.  
100 East Davie Street  
Raleigh, NC 27601  
USA

### FAQ

**Q. What is the purpose of the BPCA?**  
A. The BPCA exists for one main reason: to ensure that contributions to Bonsai have acceptable licensing terms. 

**Q. If I agree to the BPCA, am I assigning copyright to Bonsai, Goncalo Lopes, or NeuroGEARS?**  
A. No. The BPCA is not a copyright assignment agreement. 

**Q. Does this mean that Bonsai will always relicense my contributions from $MY_LICENSE to MIT?**  
A. No. If you put a Free license on your contribution, we will use it under the terms of that license. If you put it under a non-Free license, we won't use it at all. Only unlicensed contributions where the copyright holder is the Bonsai contributor qualify for the "default licensing" clause. 

**Q. Do I need to physically sign the BPCA?**  
A. No. We require that all contributors agree to it digitally, through **[WE NEED TO DECIDE ON A PROCESS FOR THIS]**. If you wish to additionally sign a physical copy and send it to us, the BPCA describes how to do this, but it is **NOT** required. 

**Q. Are all Bonsai users/distributors required to agree to the BPCA?**  
A. No. Only Bonsai contributors will be required to agree to the BPCA. However, if you want to agree to it, you always can :)

**Q. The BPCA defines "default licenses" of MIT for code, and Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 for content, why not $OTHER_LICENSE?**  
A. These licenses were chosen because of their widespread use and compatibility with most other Free licenses.

**Q. I have a question/suggestion/flame about the BPCA that is not covered here, where should I send it to?**  
A. If you want to discuss it in public, please subscribe to the **[BONSAI FORUM? DISCORD?]** and post your thoughts there. If you do not wish to discuss it in public, feel free to send it via email to **legal@bonsaiproject.org [PLACEHOLDER]**.
